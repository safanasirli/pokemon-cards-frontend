## Project Description
Hi! Welcome to our project: PokeMon Sanctuary. This project was designed to test/reinforce our MERN/CRUD understanding in a group setting. We decided that
a E-commerce app simulating the purchase of PokeMon from an adoption agency would be the best way to demonstrate our knowledge in a unique way. 

The app is comprised of: a landing page with cards displaying the PokeMon up for adoption, a Nav bar that routes to other pages renders in the app, and interactive cards
thats redirect the user to the PokeMon's price and description when clicked.

Each team was assigned role split evenly between FrontEnd and BackEnd development to ensure even workflow. 

Credits to all those who contributed.
